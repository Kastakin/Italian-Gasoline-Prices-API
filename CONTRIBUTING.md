# Contributing to Italian-Gasoline-Prices-API

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests!

If you are new to the game (maybe this could be your first contribution! Yay!) I suggest you to check out this [awesome guide on contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) that really helped me to get started when I first began contributing!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU AGPLv3 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU AGPLv3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/kastakin/italian-gasoline-prices-api/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

The more info you can give the easier will be for anyone to try to help you!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Try to keep the coding style as consistent as possible, when writing python code try to adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) rules as much as possible!
